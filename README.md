# Text-Social-Media-and-Web-Analytics
# 1. Introduction
The project titled Taxi Drivers’ Earnings Optimization aims to enhance the income levels of taxi drivers by leveraging text and social media web analytics techniques. In urban mobility systems, taxi drivers often face challenges such as prolonged idle times and difficulty in identifying high-demand areas. Through the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data analytics, this project identifies key hotspots, analyzes driver feedback, and derives actionable insights for improving earnings efficiency.

# Project Objectives
The primary objective is to optimize driver performance and maximize earnings through data-driven insights. The key goals include:
•	Identifying high-demand hotspots across different city zones.
•	Reducing driver idle time between trips.
•	Analyzing driver sentiment to assess operational satisfaction.
•	Implementing NLP-based techniques to process unstructured text data related to trips, reviews, or feedback.

# Used Cases
# 1.Hotspot Identification: 
Detecting geographic zones with high ride frequency or positive sentiment trends using text-based and numerical data.

# 2. Idle Time Reduction: 
Predicting underutilized time periods for drivers and recommending optimal routes or time slots.
